    <h2>Texture and  Practice using Adobe Photoshop</h2>
    <p>Following the release of his new album, I wanted to create a potential mash up cover for the two (subjectively) best songs on each album, which was Cherry Soda (left) and Run (right). With two very different concepts in terms of visuals in the music video and sounds in the actual songs themselves, I wanted to show that distinction by splitting the design evenly in half and incorporated small aspects from each concept on their respective side. This also has a deeper meaning, showing the change from him being primarily known as just Tuv, and further showing himself as Bertie. Objectively, they are all him, but they are two distinctive "parts" of him.</p>
