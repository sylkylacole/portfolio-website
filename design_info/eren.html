    <h2>Layout and Composition Practice using Adobe InDesign</h2>
    <p>During this project, I wanted to capture the realism of an in-person wanted poster if it were to be paired with the fictional crimes of Eren Yeager, the antagonistic protagonist of the Attack on Titan series. I kept the design lack of color to mimic a black and white printed image. This was the first time I used InDesign to create a complete print-like design, so I am proud of the outcome</p>
